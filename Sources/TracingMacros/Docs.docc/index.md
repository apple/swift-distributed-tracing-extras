# ``TracingMacros``

Macro helpers for Tracing.

## Overview

The TracingMacros module provides optional macros to make it easier to write traced code.

The ``Traced()`` macro lets you avoid the extra indentation that comes with
adopting traced code. You can just attach `@Traced` to a function and get
started.
